## README
### CAPSTONE PROJECT MODULE 1
This app is created for my first capstone project at Purwadhika Digital School. The app is built around CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is used to manage student data.

The app is created using Python 3 as its programming language and does not utilize any database. All the student data you see in the app is hardcoded, meaning the data will reset every time the app is restarted. All data is fictional and does not represent any real individuals.

### Key Features
The main features of this Student Management System include:
1. View student data
2. Add new student data
3. Update existing student information
4. Delete student data

### Features Overview

#### 1. View Student Data
This feature allows you to view the full list of the student data. Information such as Student ID (SID), Name, Date of Birth (DOB), Class, Subject, and Score are displayed. 

You can also search for a specific student by their SID for further actions like updating or deleting data.

#### 2. Add New Student Data
This feature allows you to input new student data. Each field, such as SID, Name, DOB, Class, Subject, and Score, must be filled. Input validation is applied to ensure correct data is entered, such as  DOB follows the format dd/mm/yyyy and the Score is between 0 and 100.

Once a student is added, they will appear in the student list.

#### 3. Update Existing Student Data
You can modify a student's data by providing their SID. The system will allow you to update variables like Name, DOB, Class, Subject, and Score. If you leave any field blank, the current value will remain unchanged.

Input validation ensures that the updates follow the correct format.

#### 4. Delete Student Data
This feature allows you to remove a studentâ€™s data by entering their SID. Once deleted, the student will no longer be listed.
